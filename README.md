                 I am a mid-level front end engineer based in London. I love building project using React and TypeScript.
                        I am really passionate about testing my code so I relly heavily on Cypress and Vitest
                                         ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in anything to do with front end but particularly TypeScript
                                                     ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Astro
